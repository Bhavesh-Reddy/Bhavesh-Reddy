  # Hi, I'm Bhavesh Reddy ⚡
  
  <h3>Architecting Autonomous Systems & Next-Gen AI</h3>

  <p>
    <b>Senior Developer @ SDC</b> | <b>IIT Madras BS Data Science</b> | <b>Edge AI Innovator</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I engineer systems that exist on the bleeding edge. From building <b>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)</b> models for network security to designing <b>autonomous drone navigation</b> pipelines, I bridge the gap between full-stack engineering and complex AI architectures.
